# The yeet programming language

**yeet** is a beautifully simple and readable functional esoteric programming language based on the lambda calculus.

A **yeet** program consists only of different-length yeets.

The [Y-Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Y_combinator) in **yeet**:

```yeet
yeet yeeet yeet
  yeet yeeeet yeet
    yeeet yeet yeet yeeeet yeeeet YEET
  YEET
  yeet yeeeet yeet
    yeeet yeet yeet yeeeet yeeeet YEET
  YEET
YEET
```

## Project status

Currently, the **yeet** programming language has as a [specification](spec.md) and a working parser; An interpreter and more examples will follow.
